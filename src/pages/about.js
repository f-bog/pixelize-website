      <h1>The Origin Story</h1>
      <p>
        Our millennial love for all things digital and internet-based has been a
        staple in our lives, always appearing in the form of fun little side
        projects for friends and family but due to the demanding, fast-paced
        lifestyle of good ol’ Los Angeles, California and the need to put food
        on the table, we put our dream of starting our own Digital Agency on
        hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the following years, we watched our family members create
        many successful small businesses, only to then, many years later, leave
        it all behind and move to their new home on the beautiful Gold Coast,
        Australia and start building their businesses from the ground up…once
        again. While we carefully observed the mindset and determination it took
        to start a new business in a new country, we learned the important role
        that having a good website plays, and how critical it can be to the
        success of your business, and this sparked a fuse! With our technical
        knowledge, creative ability along with some hands-on experience (and a
        couple years later) Pixelize was born!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Pixelize’s beginning, we wanted it to be different. No gimmicky
        sales tactics and most importantly, no trying to swindle you through
        dishonest advice and misinformation. We have always believed the best
        way we as a company can be truly successful, is if we treat each of our
        client’s projects as if they were our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality work and honest customer service have always been the core of
        Pixelize because your satisfaction and success in the projects we do for
        you is the best way to measure our own!
