# How long will it take for my SEO to work?

This is a common question people ask about their SEO, but ultimately, the answer requires more questions about your specific website and business.

Generally speaking, websites can start seeing results around the 6-9 month mark but keep in mind, SEO results grow over time, and many factors can affect this process.

## The SEO factors

There are a lot of variables that can influence how quickly you see results after you start doing SEO, such as:

- How competitive your market is
- Is your website on a global scale or small town scale
- Content quality
- Web design
- Domain age
- How often you upkeep your website's content/SEO

And even how a brand new website can take up to a month just for search engine algorithms (Google) to begin to "crawl" and "log" the content of your website.

All these factors contribute to how long it will take to see the effects of your SEO.

## What about paid ads?

As tempting as it may be to take the quick win by using a "paid ads" only approach, it, unfortunately, is not very effective. With 94% of people clicking on organic results and around 6% clicking on paid ads, you can see how this tactic does not achieve the results you are after,nor is it very cost efficient. Paid ads have always worked best in correlation with quality SEO.

## In a nutshell

Search Engine Optimisation has always provided the best ROI (return on investment) due to its mastery over building brands, growing online presence and generating free quality foot-traffic, but it takes time.

In many ways, SEO is the internet's version of planting a seed, through correct seed placement, quality soil, along with plenty of water, sunshine and some TLC, you will watch your SEO tree grow tall and strong in no time!
